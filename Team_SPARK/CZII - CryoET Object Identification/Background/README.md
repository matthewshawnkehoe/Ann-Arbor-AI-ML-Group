## Overview

This repository contains notebooks to facilitate entries in the CZ CryoET ML Challenge. These notebooks are organized as follows:

- [overview.ipynb](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks/blob/main/overview.ipynb): how to use, visualize, process, and sample the cryoET datasets
- [blob_detector_inference.ipynb](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks/blob/main/blob_detector_inference.ipynb): a fast end-to-end example of processing zarrs and generating a submission
- [3d_unet_monai](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks/tree/main/3d_unet_monai): training and inference notebooks using a 3D UNet with MONAI and PyTorch
- [DeepFindET](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks/tree/main/DeepFindET): training and inference using a Tensorflow-based 3D UNet
- [tomotwin_picking_notebook](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks/tree/main/tomotwin_picking_notebook): training and inference with the TomoTwin cryo-ET embedding model
