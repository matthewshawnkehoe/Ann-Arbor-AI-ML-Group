It uses a backend to serve chunks of the test data, which your model must run inference on before the next chunk is served. Because of this, you have to include some required code for your submission to work.\n\nThe evaluation API requires that you set up a server which will respond to inference requests. We have already defined the server; you just need write the predict function. When we evaluate your submission on the hidden test set the client defined in `mcts_gateway` will run in a different container with direct access to the hidden test set and hand off the data in batches of 100.\n\nYour code will always have access to the published copies of the files.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport sys\n\nimport polars as pl\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\ncomp_path = Path('/kaggle/input/um-game-playing-strength-of-mcts-variants')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-19T02:27:09.859525Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-19T02:27:09.859931Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-19T02:27:11.953685Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-19T02:27:09.859868Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-19T02:27:11.952571Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Critical import","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import kaggle_evaluation.mcts_inference_server","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-19T02:27:11.955542Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-19T02:27:11.955996Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-19T02:27:12.542776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-19T02:27:11.955963Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-19T02:27:12.541678Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Building a model\n\nThis example trains a model inline, but you will probably want to train a model offline, import it, and just use the notebook for inference.\n\nIt's wrapped in a function because this Code format requires you to get to the `predict` function within 15 minutes.
